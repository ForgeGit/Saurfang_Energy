# Saurfang_Energy

We lack a precise, catch-all method to explain and measure energy generation on Deathbringer Saurfang (Icecrown Citadel raid boss - World of Warcraft Classic). 
We have a general idea of how it works, but we cannot explain it or measure in detail.

For all intend and purposes of this document, I will refer to Energy on Saurfang as Blood Power (A.K.A Runic Power, Blood Energy, Blood Points). 


## Introduction and current understanding

Common thirdhand sources of information such as [WoWhead Comments](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/npc=37813/deathbringer-saurfang#comments), [WowPedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deathbringer_Saurfang), and [WoW-Wiki](https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Deathbringer_Saurfang), plus "common knowledge" from Class Discords, [Blizzard Forums from 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20100213045756/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=22749002374&sid=1&pageNo=1) and PTR experience, all coincide more or less on the following:

- Only spell-related damage should count towards Blood Power generation
    - Boiling Blood, Rune of Blood, Blood Nova, and Beast melee damage).
    - Melee damage from boss on the tanks should not contribute towards Blood Power generation (unless it is a Rune of Blood hit).
    
- In Heroic mode blood power generation seems much faster compared to normal mode.

There are, however, conflicting or vague attempts at explaining the underlying mechanics of Blood Power generation. Specifically: 

- Does "Absorbed" damage count towards Blood Power generation?
    - An old comment suggests Absorbed damage would not count towards Blood Power generation
    
          - A wowhead comment from the 18th December 2009 stated by 7103 on 2009/12/19 (Patch 3.3.0) says "he doesn't gain blood power unless he actually deals damage, meaning a disc priest perma-bubbling our tank and our add kiters doing a stellar job resulted in him only having one mark up when he died."
    
- Does "Mark" damage count towards Blood Power generation?
    - It is suggested mark damage (or the more "Mark" targets are out? subtle but important difference on damage vs pressence of) increases Blood Power generation over time.
        - Is this because damage "ramps up"? 
        - Does it add 1 extra Blood Power or is it 1 extra Blood Power per tick? 
         
- Exactly how much Blood Energy does a Boiling Blood tick contribute? 
      - It is said boiling blood generates somewhere around 2 and 4 Blood Power. [Old websites](https://typehforheals.com/raid-strategies/wrath-of-the-lich-king/icecrown-citadel/deathbringer-saurfang/#:~:text=Besides%20Blood%20Nova%2C%20Saurfang%20will%20be%20casting%20Boiling,or%20Divine%20Shield%20this%20should%20be%20done%20immediately), [wordpress pages](https://dontstandinthefire.wordpress.com/tactics/icecrown-citadel/deathbringer-saurfang-10-man/) and even WoWHead comments from the past give us some numbers that usually disagree with each other. 
      
      - It is also said it generates more blood power based on damage, however, we know from looking at videos + log simultaneously [2] that the same boiling blood ticking for the same amount of damage went from giving 2 Blood Power, to giving 3 Blood Power. (E.g. Two consecutive ticks of 6,500 damage each giving 2 and 3 Blood Power respectively)
