# Saurfang_Energy

We lack a precise, catch-all method to explain and measure energy generation on Deathbringer Saurfang (Icecrown Citadel raid boss - World of Warcraft Classic). 
We have a general idea of how it works, but we cannot explain it or measure in detail.

For all intend and purposes of this document, I will refer to Energy on Saurfang as Blood Power (A.K.A Runic Power, Blood Energy, Blood Points). 


## Introduction and current understanding

Common thirdhand sources of information such as [WoWhead Comments](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/npc=37813/deathbringer-saurfang#comments), [WowPedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Deathbringer_Saurfang), and [WoW-Wiki](https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Deathbringer_Saurfang), plus "common knowledge" from Class Discords, [Blizzard Forums from 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20100213045756/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=22749002374&sid=1&pageNo=1) and PTR experience, all coincide more or less on the following:

- "He doesn't gain blood power unless he actually deals damage"

- Only spell-related damage count towards Blood Power generation (Boiling Blood, Rune of Blood, Blood Nova, and Beast melee damage).
    - i.e. Melee damage from boss on tanks does not contribute towards Blood Power generation.

- "In Heroic mode [...] blood power gain is much faster compared to normal mode."

There are, however, conflicting or vague attempts at explaining in detail how Blood Power generation works. Specifically: 

- Does "Absorbed" damage count towards Blood Power generation?

      - An old comment suggests Absorbed damage would not count towards Blood Power generation 
          - A wowhead comment from the 18th December 2009 stated by 7103 on 2009/12/19 (Patch 3.3.0) says "he doesn't gain blood power unless he actually deals damage, meaning a disc priest perma-bubbling our tank and our add kiters doing a stellar job resulted in him only having one mark up when he died."
    
- Does "Mark" damage count towards Blood Power generation?

      - It is suggested mark damage (or the more "Mark" targets are out? subtle but important difference on damage vs pressence of) increases Blood Power generation over time. Is this because damage "ramps up"? Does it add 1 extra Blood Power or is it 1 extra Blood Power per tick? 
         
- Exactly how much Blood Energy does a Boiling Blood tick contribute? 
      
      - It is said boiling blood generates somewhere around 2 and 4 Blood Power.
      - It is also said it generates more blood power based on damage, however, we know from looking at videos + log [2] the same boiling blood ticking for the same amount of damage went from giving 2 to 3 blood power. (E.g. Two consecutive ticks of 6,500 damage each giving 2 and 3 blood power respectively)
